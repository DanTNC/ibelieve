map NT to access_token and refresh_token (check all scopes (search, playlist, play, device, ...))

use playback sdk for setting up device (get device_id)

get access_token from backend

use search or playlist to get spotify_uri

use spotify connect web api to connect to device_id

use getOAuthToken function of player to play a spotify_uri

when sending any request check if token expires and use a refresh_token to refresh the token when it does

save mapping to mongodb instead of memory
